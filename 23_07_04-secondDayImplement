Yesteday, I create a first workflow in action with codeql as security and add this new branch lucianoCircelli-patch-codeql. This action don't run, the write call C# and this forked repository uses C# and PowerShell. 
I all deleted but remains 3 commits then the branch is always visible in upload repository but any code.
I don't know the next steps.
Cloning in local this repository and refresh by dotnet 
It is possible that repository seek what is implemented before this new motheboard. 
this forked repository failled much in build action where I don't unterstand very link with upload Azure
